## Task Format

Every task follows the enhanced format with:
- Context & purpose with user value
- Comprehensive success criteria
- TDD implementation plan
- Risk assessment and definition of done

## Task Flow

Tasks automatically move through phases:
1. Created in `analysis/` for deep thinking
2. Moved to `backlog/` when analysis complete and blockers resolved
3. Moved to `in-progress/` when development begins
4. Moved to `testing/` for comprehensive validation
5. Moved to `completed/` when fully verified and ready for deployment
