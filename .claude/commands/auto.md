# /auto - Autonomous Development Workflow

"Ultra Think before you build" - Execute complete lifecycle with automatic task progression and folder management.

## Usage
- `/auto` - Process next available task from backlog with feedback checkpoints
- `/auto <task_description>` - Execute specific task with human feedback
- `/auto --continuous` - Run continuously until all backlog tasks complete (backend/API tasks)
- `/auto --interactive` - Interactive mode with frequent feedback checkpoints (frontend/UI tasks)
- `/auto --silent` - Fully autonomous mode with no human feedback (data processing/utility tasks)

## Autonomous Task Management

### 1. Task Discovery & Selection
- Automatically scan `tasks/backlog/` for next available task
- Respect task dependencies and priority ordering
- Load task details and success criteria

### 2. Task Lifecycle with Folder Management
**🔄 Task Progression**: `backlog/` → `in-progress/` → `testing/` → `completed/`

- **Start**: Move task from `tasks/backlog/` to `tasks/in-progress/`
- **Build Phase**: Keep in `in-progress/` during development
- **Testing**: Move to `tasks/testing/` when implementation complete
- **Complete**: Move to `tasks/completed/` when all criteria met

### 3. Workflow Phases (with Human Feedback)

**🤔 Understand**: Analyze requirements, dependencies, risks, success criteria
- **Frontend Tasks**: Present wireframes/mockups interpretation → Get approval
- **All Tasks**: Show implementation approach → Get confirmation

**📋 Plan**: Break into subtasks, create dependency graph, define testing strategy  
- **Interactive Mode**: Present detailed implementation plan → Get feedback
- **Frontend Tasks**: Show component architecture and state management approach → Get approval

**🔨 Build**: Implement with TDD, auto-retry failures (3x), apply best practices
- **Checkpoint 1**: After core functionality → Demo/screenshot → Get feedback
- **Checkpoint 2**: After styling/UI → Live preview → Get design feedback  
- **Checkpoint 3**: After interactions → User flow demo → Get UX feedback
- **Backend Tasks**: After API implementation → Test with Postman/curl → Get validation

**🧪 Test**: Comprehensive validation - ensure built solution matches spec, catch remaining issues
- **Frontend Tasks**: Cross-browser testing results → Get compatibility approval
- **All Tasks**: Test results summary → Get quality approval

**✅ Complete**: Update status, move task file, proceed to next task
- **Final Review**: Present completed feature → Get final sign-off

### 4. Continuous Operation
- After completing a task, automatically start next available task
- Handle task dependencies and blocking conditions
- Maintain project status tracking throughout
- Only pause for manual intervention when blocked

## Feedback Modes

### Default Mode (`/auto`)
- **Human Checkpoints**: 2-3 feedback points per task
- **Best For**: General development tasks, API endpoints, business logic
- **Feedback Timing**: After major milestones (functionality complete, testing complete)

### Interactive Mode (`/auto --interactive`) 
- **Human Checkpoints**: 4-6 feedback points per task
- **Best For**: Frontend development, UI/UX work, design-heavy tasks
- **Feedback Timing**: After every significant visual change or user interaction
- **Special Features**: 
  - Live preview generation for frontend changes
  - Screenshot comparisons with design mockups
  - Accessibility testing results presentation
  - Real-time style guide compliance checking

### Continuous Mode (`/auto --continuous`)
- **Human Checkpoints**: Minimal - only on errors or blockers
- **Best For**: Backend services, data processing, infrastructure tasks
- **Feedback Timing**: Only when manual intervention required
- **Runs**: Entire backlog sequentially with minimal human interaction

### Silent Mode (`/auto --silent`)
- **Human Checkpoints**: None (fully autonomous)
- **Best For**: Utility functions, unit tests, documentation updates, refactoring
- **Feedback Timing**: Only final completion notification
- **Quality Assurance**: Extra emphasis on comprehensive testing and validation

## Key Features

### Full Project (Continuous Mode)
```bash
/auto --continuous
# Processes entire backlog with context-appropriate feedback
# Automatically switches to interactive mode for frontend tasks
# Uses default mode for mixed tasks
# Uses silent mode for utilities and tests
```

## Automatic Task Type Detection

The AI automatically determines the appropriate feedback level based on task content:

### Frontend/UI Tasks (→ Interactive Mode)
**Keywords**: "UI", "component", "page", "form", "styling", "responsive", "design", "user interface", "frontend", "React", "Vue", "Angular"
**Feedback**: High frequency with visual previews and design validation

### Backend/API Tasks (→ Default Mode)  
**Keywords**: "API", "endpoint", "database", "authentication", "service", "backend", "server", "integration"
**Feedback**: Moderate frequency with functional testing and security review

### Utility/Infrastructure Tasks (→ Silent Mode)
**Keywords**: "refactor", "test", "documentation", "utility", "helper", "config", "setup", "migration"
**Feedback**: Minimal frequency with completion notification

### Mixed Tasks (→ Default Mode)
**Keywords**: Full-stack features, complex workflows spanning frontend and backend
**Feedback**: Adaptive frequency based on current implementation phase

## Implementation Details

### Task File Movement
```bash
# Automatic task progression handled by the AI agent:
mv tasks/backlog/task-001.md tasks/in-progress/
# ... development work ...
mv tasks/in-progress/task-001.md tasks/testing/
# ... testing and validation ...
mv tasks/testing/task-001.md tasks/completed/
```

### Continuous Processing Script
The workflow includes a helper script for continuous operation:
```bash
.claude/scripts/continuous-auto.sh --continuous
```

## Context Management Integration

### Automatic Context Optimization
The `/auto` command now includes intelligent context management:

**Proactive Context Monitoring**:
- **Green Zone (0-60%)**: Full context maintained for optimal AI performance
- **Yellow Zone (60-80%)**: Selective pruning of low-priority content
- **Orange Zone (80-90%)**: Aggressive pruning, preserve only task-critical context
- **Red Zone (90%+)**: Emergency context preservation and intelligent reset

**Context-Aware Task Execution**:
```bash
/auto --context-aware "implement user dashboard"
# AI automatically:
# 1. Creates context snapshot before starting
# 2. Monitors context usage during development  
# 3. Prunes non-dashboard content as needed
# 4. Preserves all dashboard decisions and code context
# 5. Restores relevant context when switching tasks
```

### Task-Specific Context Snapshots
Automatic snapshots are created at key points:
- **Before starting new tasks** (preserve previous context)
- **After completing milestones** (preserve decision context)
- **Before major refactoring** (preserve pre-change state)
- **When context reaches 80%** (safety backup)
- **When switching between features** (enable seamless transitions)

### Context Restoration
```bash
# AI automatically restores relevant context when:
/auto "continue user authentication work"
# Loads: previous auth context, file modifications, user feedback, debugging state

/auto "fix login endpoint bug"  
# Loads: authentication context, error history, test results, related code
```

## Status Monitoring
```bash
# Enhanced monitoring with context awareness
cat ./.claude/project_status.json
tail -f ./.claude/logs/autonomous-workflow.log
find tasks/ -name "*.md" | sort

# Context-specific monitoring
/context status                 # Current context usage and health
/context snapshots             # Available context snapshots for restoration
tail -f ./.claude/context/context-management.log  # Context optimization log
```
