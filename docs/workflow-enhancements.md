# Workflow Enhancements

## Enhanced Planning Options

### Problem: Incomplete Task Creation
**Solution**: Two planning modes to suit different preferences

#### Standard Planning (Phased)
```bash
/plan
```
- Creates 3-5 primary tasks immediately
- Generates analysis summary for remaining work
- Use `/plan-continue` to expand remaining tasks later
- Good for iterative development

#### Complete Planning (All Tasks Upfront)  
```bash
/plan --complete
```
- Extended 45-60 minute planning session
- Creates ALL detailed tasks immediately
- All tasks ready in backlog for autonomous execution
- Good for complete project planning

### Continue Planning
```bash
/plan-continue
```
- Reads existing analysis summaries
- Converts summaries into actionable tasks
- Adds tasks to backlog with proper dependencies
- Maintains task numbering and relationships

## Enhanced Auto Command

### Problem: Manual Task Progression
**Solution**: Automatic task lifecycle management

#### Task Folder Management
Tasks automatically move through folders:
```
tasks/backlog/ → tasks/in-progress/ → tasks/testing/ → tasks/completed/
```

#### Execution Modes
```bash
/auto                    # Process next single task
/auto --continuous       # Process entire backlog sequentially
/auto <task_description> # Execute specific task
```

#### Continuous Processing
- After completing a task, automatically starts the next one
- Respects task dependencies and priority ordering
- Updates project status after each state change
- Only stops when backlog is empty or blocked

## Monitoring & Status

### Project Status
```bash
cat .claude/project_status.json
```
Shows real-time task counts across all folders.

### Workflow Logs
```bash
tail -f .claude/logs/autonomous-workflow.log
```
Real-time monitoring of autonomous task processing.

### Task Overview
```bash
find tasks/ -name "*.md" | sort
```
See all tasks and their current states.

## Typical Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Complete Planning + Autonomous Execution
```bash
/plan --complete          # Create all tasks upfront
/auto --continuous        # Process entire backlog
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Planning + Development
```bash
/plan                     # Initial planning
/auto                     # Work on first tasks
/plan-continue            # Expand remaining tasks
/auto --continuous        # Continue development
```

### Pattern 3: Specific Task Focus
```bash
/plan                     # Initial planning
/auto "implement user auth" # Work on specific task
/auto                     # Continue with next task
```

## Benefits

✅ **No Task Loss**: All analysis gets converted to actionable tasks
✅ **Continuous Flow**: Autonomous execution without manual intervention
✅ **Clear Progress**: Visual task movement through folder states
✅ **Flexible Planning**: Choose phased or complete planning approach
✅ **Dependency Handling**: Respects task relationships and blocking conditions
✅ **Status Tracking**: Real-time visibility into project progress
